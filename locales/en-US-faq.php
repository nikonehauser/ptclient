'Which regions are you doing social projects in?',

'In India. They will be only in those Indian regions where our donators
and with that the donations come from.
If you have any interesting project suggestions, please do not hesitate
to contact us.',




'Can I follow the projects?',

'Yes! The progress will be published on www.shadowfoundation.org and on
social media.',




'Why are you based in Kashmir?',
'By chance. But our social projects will be carried out in the regions
the donators are from. So by you donation (or location) you can decide
where the next projects are going to be.',


'Does Betterliving only operate in Kashmir?',
'No, Betterliving is here for everybody in India. Everyone can be a
donator and also receive money with us. So by you donation (or location)
you can decide where the next projects are going to be.',


'Is this a chain system?',

'No! It\'s definitely more likely to a network as it is known in several direct
marketing systems for products and services in different industries.
So this network is not really anything new commercially. What is new
though, is that we are carrying out social projects with a network like
that.
So we are using something that internationally has been successful
throughout many industries to be able to realize social projects in
India. On top of that everybody gets the chance to make a little fortune
with minimal effort.
Through a new mathematical algorithm, the Betterliving platform prevents
the donations and the commissions from stagnating early on, just because a
few people do not get more new donators for whatever reason. It really is enough if everybody only
recruits three more donators in order to get a quite big amount of money.
Even if the average is less than three people who donate, the network
and donation flow will not stand still just like the commissions you will get.
You can watch the explanation video several times to fully understand
how it works. The expansion of your commissions are explained in a realistic
an understandable way.
In case you recruit three donators yourself you can still top your
profit by advertising new donators anytime you want!
You will indeed get more payments than you had donated before and on top
of that you support social projects in India by doing so.
You will receive a lot of money and we can carry out several social
projects in India.
What more do you want?',



'Why do you need my bank account details?',

'We need your account details in order to weekly transfer your commissions.
Betterliving is new and unique because you will be a donator and
fundraiser at the same time. As soon as your first recruited donator is
on board, you will receive your first commissions.
For the first and the second donator you receive 300 Rupees each. From
the third one it will be 1500 Rupees each.
As soon as you have recruited three donators you get access to the
donators’ network. New donators will be allocated to you who you do
not know and most possibly never get to know either.
From this point on donators will be allocated to you anonymously by the
network. You receive 1200 Rupees for each of those.
As soon as one of these donators advertises one or more others, you can
automatically receive many thousand Rupees through the mathematical
algorithm.',



'How can I make money without constantly being active?',

'What makes this network so unique is that you will become a well-paid
fundraiser being a donator.
As soon as you find donators, we will directly transfer your commissions to
your account.
Also you can get paid for donators that you indirectly have advertised
without even knowing them.
Of course it cannot run by doing nothing.
But all you have to do is recruit three donators. From this point on you
get access to the network new donators will be allocated to you who
you do not know and most possibly never get to know either.
For the first two donators you get 300 Rupees each, from the third on
you get 1500 Rupees each and a donator that has been allocated to you
makes 1200 Rupees for you!
Now this does not sound like a lot of money yet. But through our
mathematical algorithm of the network you can automatically receive many
thousand Rupees. Just watch the video once again to make it clear.',



'How is the donation paid?',

'As soon as you register to our platform you get an email with your
login details and bank account details of the NGO to transfer your
money. You are the one who decides how your donation is paid: You can
transfer it or make a cash deposit at the bank. Please note that we do
not offer payments by credit cards or other online methods in order to
avoid fees.
You should pay within 10 days. You can start to find new donators with
your donator number immediately though. You will get paid for finding
new donators after we received your complete donation. It is not
possible to offset your donation against the commissions you get for
advertising donators.',


'Do I have to find all possible donators immediately?',

'You are the one who decides how many donators you advertise. By
donating 5500 Rupees you are authorized to recruit new donators and get
paid for finding them. So you can rule whether your payments roll in
fast or slowly.
For example:
You join Betterliving today. You donate and get your donator number. The
same week you find three new donators who all donate as well and state
your donator number.
That is all you do.
When every future donator acts the same way you did you will receive
38.400.00 Rupees two weeks later and after eight weeks it could be about
2.5 million Rupees!
You will receive all payments on your private bank account weekly.
Of course you can get even more than this: Just advertise more
donators. It is all in your hands - if you find more donators you will get
higher commissions.',




'Does Betterliving co-operate with any religious or political
organization?',

'No!
We are completely independent and have nothing to do with any religious,
political or other organisations.',




'Can I influence the projects?',

'Yes!
Every donator can suggest interesting social projects. Please contact us
via project@betterliving.social and tell us about the project you are
thinking about. Regarding the amount of emails it will not always be
possible to reply to each of them but all suggestions will be collected.
A committee from different areas of India will decide which social
projects will be carried out.',


'When will I receive my money?',

'We balance your payments and transfer the money to your bank account
weekly.
In conclusion: If you successfully become involved with us you will
receive money every week.',
