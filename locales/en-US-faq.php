'Which regions are you doing social projects in?',

'In India. They will be only in those Indian regions where our customers
and with that the donations come from.
If you have any interesting project suggestions, please do not hesitate
to contact us.',




// 'Can I follow the projects?',

// 'Yes! The progress will be published on www.shadowfoundation.org and on
// social media.',




// 'Why are you based in Kashmir?',
// 'By chance. But our social projects will be carried out in the regions
// the customers are from. So by you donation (or location) you can decide
// where the next projects are going to be.',


// 'Does Betterliving only operate in Kashmir?',
// 'No, Betterliving is here for everybody in India. Everyone can be a
// customer and also receive money with us. So by you donation (or location)

'Is this a chain system?',

'<p>No! It\'s definitely a network marketing or a multi-level-marketing-system as it is known in several direct marketing systems for products and services in different industries.</p>

<p>Through a new mathematical algorithm the Better Living platform prevents that the payment of commissions stagnating because a few people do not recruit more new customers for whatever reason.</p>

<p>It´s really enough if everybody only recruits three new customers in order to earn a quite big amount of money. Even if the average is less than three customers, the marketing system and commission flow will not stand still. You can watch the explanation video several times to fully understand how it works.</p>

<p>The expansions of your commissions are explained in the video in a realistic and understandable way. In case you recruit three customers yourself you can still top your profit by recruiting new customers anytime you want!</p>

<p>You will earn much more money than you had paid for your Happiness Guide before. Our Happiness Guide will indicate you a lot of ways to a happier life. Our marketing system is for example a very easy way to happiness.</p>

<p>Don´t worry and take your unique chance now and get your personal better life!</p>',

'Why do you need my bank account details?',

'We need your account details in order to weekly transfer your commissions.
Betterliving is new and unique because you will be a customer and
fundraiser at the same time. As soon as your first recruited customer is
on board, you will receive your first commissions.
For the first and the second customer you receive 4 Dollar each. From
the third one it will be 24 Dollar each.
As soon as you have recruited three customers you get access to the
customers’ network. New customers will be allocated to you who you do
not know and most possibly never get to know either.
From this point on customers will be allocated to you anonymously by the
network. You receive 20 Dollar for each of those.
As soon as one of these customers advertises one or more others, you can
automatically receive many thousand Dollar through the mathematical
algorithm.',



// next
'How can I make money without constantly being active?',

'<p>What makes this marketing system so unique is that you become a well-paid recommendation giver. As soon as you find customers, we will directly transfer your commissions to your privat payment gateway account.</p>

<p>Also you can get paid for customers that you indirectly have recruit without even knowing them. Of course it cannot run by doing nothing. But all you have to do is recruit three customers.</p>

<p>From this point on you get access to the marketing system. New customers will be allocated to you who you do not know and most possibly never get to know either. For the first two customers you get $ 4.00 each, from the third on you get $ 24.00 each and a customer that has been allocated to you makes $ 20.00 for you!</p>

<p>Now this does not sound like a lot of money yet. But through our mathematical algorithm of the marketing system you can automatically receive many thousand US-Dollars. Just watch the video once again to make it clear.</p>',

'How is the donation paid?',

'As soon as you register to our platform you get an email with your
login details and bank account details of the NGO to transfer your
money. You are the one who decides how your donation is paid: You can
transfer it or make a cash deposit at the bank. Please note that we do
not offer payments by credit cards or other online methods in order to
avoid fees.
You should pay within 10 days. You can start to find new customers with
your customer number immediately though. You will get paid for finding
new customers after we received your complete donation. It is not
possible to offset your donation against the commissions you get for
advertising customers.',


// next
'Do I have to find all possible customers immediately?',

'<p>You are the one who decides when and how many customers you recruit. If you are a customer of Better Living you are authorized to recruit new customers and get paid for finding them. So you can definite whether your payments roll in fast or slowly.</p>

<p>For example: You join Better Living today and become a customer of Better Living. You pay your purchase price for your Happiness guide and get your customer number. The same week you find three new customers who all become customers of Better Living as well and state your customer number. That is all you do.</p>

<p>When every future customer acts the same way you did you will receive $ 640.00 two weeks later and after eight weeks it could be about $ 30,000.00 per week! You will receive all payments on your private payment gateway account weekly. Of course you can get even more than this: Just recruit more customers. It is all in your hands - if you find more customers you will get higher commissions.</p>',
