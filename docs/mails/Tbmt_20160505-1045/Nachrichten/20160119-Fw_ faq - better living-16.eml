&#39;Which regions are you doing social projects in?&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
&#39;In India. They will be only in those Indian regions where our donators<br/>
and with that the donations come from.<br/>
If you have any interesting project suggestions, please do not hesitate<br/>
to contact us.&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Can I follow the projects?&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Yes! The progress will be published on <a href="http://www.shadow-foundation.in" target="_blank">www.shadowfoundation.org</a> and on<br/>
social media.&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Why are you based in Kashmir?&#39;,<br/>
&#39;By chance. But our social projects will be carried out in the regions<br/>
the donators are from. So by you donation (or location) you can decide<br/>
where the next projects are going to be.&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Does Betterliving only operate in Kashmir?&#39;,<br/>
&#39;No, Betterliving is here for everybody in India. Everyone can be a<br/>
donator and also receive money with us. So by you donation (or location)<br/>
you can decide where the next projects are going to be.&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Is this a chain system?&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
&#39;No! It&#39;s definitely more likely to a network as it is known in several direct<br/>
marketing systems for products and services in different industries.<br/>
So this network is not really anything new commercially. What is new<br/>
though, is that we are carrying out social projects with a network like<br/>
that.<br/>
So we are using something that internationally has been successful<br/>
throughout many industries to be able to realize social projects in<br/>
India. On top of that everybody gets the chance to make a little fortune<br/>
with minimal effort.<br/>
Through a new mathematical algorithm, the Betterliving platform prevents<br/>
the donations and the commissions from stagnating early on, just because a<br/>
few people do not get more new donators for whatever reason. It really is enough if everybody only<br/>
recruits three more donators in order to get a quite big amount of money.<br/>
Even if the average is less than three people who donate, the network<br/>
and donation flow will not stand still just like the commissions you will get.<br/>
You can watch the explanation video several times to fully understand<br/>
how it works. The expansion of your commissions are explained in a realistic<br/>
an understandable way.<br/>
In case you recruit three donators yourself you can still top your<br/>
profit by advertising new donators anytime you want!<br/>
You will indeed get more payments than you had donated before and on top<br/>
of that you support social projects in India by doing so.<br/>
You will receive a lot of money and we can carry out several social<br/>
projects in India.<br/>
What more do you want?&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Why do you need my bank account details?&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
&#39;We need your account details in order to weekly transfer your commissions.<br/>
Betterliving is new and unique because you will be a donator and<br/>
fundraiser at the same time. As soon as your first recruited donator is<br/>
on board, you will receive your first commissions.<br/>
For the first and the second donator you receive 300 Rupees each. From<br/>
the third one it will be 1500 Rupees each.<br/>
As soon as you have recruited three donators you get access to the<br/>
donators&rsquo; network. New donators will be allocated to you who you do<br/>
not know and most possibly never get to know either.<br/>
 From this point on donators will be allocated to you anonymously by the<br/>
network. You receive 1200 Rupees for each of those.<br/>
As soon as one of these donators advertises one or more others, you can<br/>
automatically receive many thousand Rupees through the mathematical<br/>
algorithm.&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;How can I make money without constantly being active?&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
&#39;What makes this network so unique is that you will become a well-paid<br/>
fundraiser being a donator.<br/>
As soon as you find donators, we will directly transfer your commissions to<br/>
your account.<br/>
Also you can get paid for donators that you indirectly have advertised<br/>
without even knowing them.<br/>
Of course it cannot run by doing nothing.<br/>
But all you have to do is recruit three donators. From this point on you<br/>
get access to the network new donators will be allocated to you who<br/>
you do not know and most possibly never get to know either.<br/>
For the first two donators you get 300 Rupees each, from the third on<br/>
you get 1500 Rupees each and a donator that has been allocated to you<br/>
makes 1200 Rupees for you!<br/>
Now this does not sound like a lot of money yet. But through our<br/>
mathematical algorithm of the network you can automatically receive many<br/>
thousand Rupees. Just watch the video once again to make it clear.&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;How is the donation paid?&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
&#39;As soon as you register to our platform you get an email with your<br/>
login details and bank account details of the NGO to transfer your<br/>
money. You are the one who decides how your donation is paid: You can<br/>
transfer it or make a cash deposit at the bank. Please note that we do<br/>
not offer payments by credit cards or other online methods in order to<br/>
avoid fees.<br/>
You should pay within 10 days. You can start to find new donators with<br/>
your donator number immediately though. You will get paid for finding<br/>
new donators after we received your complete donation. It is not<br/>
possible to offset your donation against the commissions you get for<br/>
advertising donators.&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Do I have to find all possible donators immediately?&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
&#39;You are the one who decides how many donators you advertise. By<br/>
donating 5500 Rupees you are authorized to recruit new donators and get<br/>
paid for finding them. So you can rule whether your payments roll in<br/>
fast or slowly.<br/>
For example:<br/>
You join Betterliving today. You donate and get your donator number. The<br/>
same week you find three new donators who all donate as well and state<br/>
your donator number.<br/>
That is all you do.<br/>
When every future donator acts the same way you did you will receive<br/>
38.400.00 Rupees two weeks later and after eight weeks it could be about<br/>
2.5 million Rupees!<br/>
You will receive all payments on your private bank account weekly.<br/>
Of course you can get even more than this: Just advertise more<br/>
donators. It is all in your hands - if you find more donators you will get<br/>
higher commissions.&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Does Betterliving co-operate with any religious or political<br/>
organization?&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
&#39;No!<br/>
We are completely independent and have nothing to do with any religious,<br/>
political or other organisations.&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Can I influence the projects?&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Yes!<br/>
Every donator can suggest interesting social projects. Please contact us<br/>
via project@betterliving.social and tell us about the project you are<br/>
thinking about. Regarding the amount of emails it will not always be<br/>
possible to reply to each of them but all suggestions will be collected.<br/>
A committee from different areas of India will decide which social<br/>
projects will be carried out.&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;When will I receive my money?&#39;,<br/>
<br/>
&#39;We balance your payments and transfer the money to your bank account<br/>
weekly.<br/>
In conclusion: If you successfully become involved with us you will<br/>
receive money every week.&#39;,<br/>
