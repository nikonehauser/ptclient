<div align="center"><strong>Betterliving</strong></div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Ganesh. He is a normal Guy from India</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently Ganesh was introduce by a friend to a Website called BETTERLIVING Club.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His friend told him unbelievable things such like making a fortune with just investing 5500 Rupees and a little bit of time. It would be sufficient to know 3 other People. The whole think was very dubious to Ganesh but he was also curious to understand the system and last but not least he would appreciate to earn money. &nbsp;Join Ganesh in understanding the system for Betterliving your life.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 1 Ganesh becomes a Club Donator Level 1</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ganesh subscribed on the Website www.Betterliving.social. &nbsp;He is asked to make a single Donation of 5500 Rupees from his bank account. He also leaves information of his bank account to receive commissions.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is now a Club Donator Level 1</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 2Ganesh learns the Club Rules 1 &amp; 2</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next Minutes you will understand how Ganesh makes a fortune with the new club</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ganesh was told that he has to find 3 new Donators. So he tells all persons he meets of the Betterliving Club and that one can make a fortune with one Donation of 5500 Rupees. Soon he finds two friends Durga and Kamal which decide to invest the 5500 Rupees and become Club Donators Level1</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Club receives 2 times 5500 Rupees to work with from Durga and Kamal</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F10&nbsp; Ganesh receives a commission of 2 times 300 Rupees on his bank account and Ganesh is now a Club Donator Level2.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F11&nbsp; Now the Balance for the account of Ganesh is minus 5500 Rupees for his Donation, plus 2x300 Rupees for Durga and Kamal. This results in minus 4900 Rupees. &gt; auf der Folie &ldquo;Refund&rdquo; in &ldquo;Commisssion&rdquo; &auml;ndern!</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F12&nbsp; In Step 3 Ganesh understand the Club Rule 1</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F13&nbsp; At the Moment the two first Donators brought by Ganesh were subscribed and Ganesh had received his commission for these two donors they will be moved to the Club Donator Level 2 right above Ganesh and continue their Work there. This is called Rule No 1. The Rule no 1 is only applied once for the first two Donators you find.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F14&nbsp; In Step 4 Ganesh understands the Club Rule2</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F15&nbsp; Ganesh is finds a new Person that is ready to join the club with his Donation. The man is called Jivan. When Jivan subscribes the Rule no2 of the Club is automatically applied.&nbsp; This Rule defines that if Ganesh brings 3 or more new Donators to the company he will be refunded with 1500 Rupees for each.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F16&nbsp; Ganesh receives 1500 Rupees for Jivan. On his Account we have a total Balance of minus 5500 Rupees for his Donation, plus 2x300 Rupees for Durga and Kamal, plus 1500 Rupees for Jivan. That results in minus 3400Rupees</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F17&nbsp; In Step 5 Ganesh understands how he builds his own Donation line and the value of it.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F18&nbsp; Jivan is also excited about the possibilities of his new Club and he finds Rati and Lila to start as Club Donators Level1.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F19&nbsp; Jivan receives 2 times 300 Rupees for Rati and Lila and Ganesh get the rest of the 1500 Rupees. He receives 2 time 1200 Rupees for Rati and Lila. So the Balance for Ganesh changes to minus 1000 Rupees. &gt; in der Folie Jivan von CD2 auf CD1 &auml;ndern!</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F20&nbsp; Also Rule 1 is automatically applied. That means that the first two Donators which were brought of a CD1 will move to the CD2 above him. And Jivan comes now automatically in the Club Donators Level 2.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F21&nbsp; Here you see that Rati and Lila are moving to Ganesh.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F22&nbsp; Now we come to the interesting step 6 where Ganesh understands that the Donation line works for him. So far he has spent 5500 Rupees and found 3 People to join the club. Now he can watch the others working for him.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F23&nbsp; Rati and Lila understand immediately how easy they can earn money with the Club and tell all their friends. They also find the first to Donators for the Cub. The Betterliving Club receives 4 times 5500 Rupees to work with.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F24&nbsp; All 3 of them receive the commissions. Rati and Lila receive get 2 time 300 Rupees each. Ganesh receives 4 times 1200 Rupees in this case.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F25&nbsp; The Balance on the bank account of Ganesh drastic changes. He has a positive Balance on his account of 3800 Rupees. &nbsp;Ganesh is starting to have fun.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F26&nbsp; Here in Step 7 Ganesh is already convinced that this is the way to betterliving. Let&rsquo;s watch how he is going to make a fortune. Remember: all Ganesh invested so far was the 5,500 Rupees and the Time to find 3 new Donators!</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F27&nbsp; Here you see the following development in the Donation line of Ganesh. Rule 1 and 2 are always applied and this way there is an exponential growth on the account of Ganesh. In this Level he has already 13.400 Rupees earned with this club</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F28&nbsp; The next Level Ganesh receives commissions of 19.200 Rupees. He has now a positive Balance on his account about 37.400 Rupees.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F29&nbsp; This is the last Levels we can show because the paper gets too small. But Ganesh way to betterliving goes on as long as each Donator fined 3 new Donators to join the Club.</div>

<div style="margin-left:21.3pt;">F30&nbsp; Ganesh is extremely happy. He has a new mission which is easy to manage and doesn&#39;t request too much of his time. He receives Commission also when he is not working himself. His friends are grateful because he gave them the same possibilities. His Family is impressed about the change of quality in their life. And the Club he is associated with donate a part of its profit for social projects in India. It&#39;s the best and the easiest mission he ever had. <strong>How about you? Do you care about Betterliving? </strong></div>
